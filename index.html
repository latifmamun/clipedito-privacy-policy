            <ul>
                <li><strong>Media Files:</strong> When you select videos, audio, or images within the App for editing, we access these files locally on your device. We do not upload or store these files on our servers unless explicitly required for app functionality (e.g., temporary caching for processing). All editing occurs on-device.</li>
                <li><strong>No Personal Account Information:</strong> The App does not require user registration, login, or collection of personal details such as name, email, or phone number.</li>
            </ul>
